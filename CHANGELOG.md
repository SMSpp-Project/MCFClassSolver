## [Unreleased]

### Added

### Changed

### Fixed

## [0.2.0] - 2026-09-12

### Added

- `MCFSolver::get_Solution()`, which builds the MCFSolution out of the data
  structures of the MCFClass solver, without writing anything into the
  MCFBlock and therefore without requiring any Variable to exist

### Changed

- the version of the module is the git tag of its repository, or the
  VERSION.txt of a release tarball, and the shared library carries it: its
  SONAME is major.minor while the major is 0, and it is installed with an
  RPATH relative to itself, so that an installed tree keeps working wherever
  it is moved
